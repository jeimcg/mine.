# Frontend (mine.)
The frontend is built with **React and Vite** for fast builds.

## Features
- **Responsive UI** with a Tumblr-esque dark pastel theme (i think).
- **Forms for journaling** with autosaving.
- **Arousal Graph UI** to track emotions.

## Setup + Installation
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```sh
   cd frontend

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install

3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
